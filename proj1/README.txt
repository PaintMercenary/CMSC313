PURPOSE OF SOFTWARE: Nickel and dime matrix libraries in C and C++.
FILES:
cplusplusmatrix.cpp (You're not gonna believe what this does)
cmatrix.cpp (Guess)
BUILD INSTRUCTIONS: hit the run button idk man they're standalone files.
TESTING METHODOLOGY: I replicated the formula given in the homework assignment and called it there. Rigorous, I know.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: The functions themselves in the C implementation SHOULD work with any matrix but the function calls in main are very specifically oriented around the test formula given in the homework.










I'm tired boss.
